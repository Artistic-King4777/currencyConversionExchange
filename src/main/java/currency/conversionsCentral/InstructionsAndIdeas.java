    // Half feel like i should have a class just for the input parameters but
    // IDK HOW I'd do that
    // DO I EVEN NEEED rateOfUSD???? or the first rate period
    // because if im tallking about 500 singapore dollars its just 500 SGD
    // 500 * its rate
    //......i dont think i do

    /*
    If I have 500 INR and I wanna knw how many USD it is
    it would be 500 / rateOfINR

    but the rate of INR is equivalent to all the other rates so how would i calculate the differences

    are there differences???

    i need input parameters somehow and somewhere

    IM MISSING A STEP SOMEWHERE
